 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.359   TIME= 23:37:10
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.359   TIME= 23:37:10
 The preconditioned conjugate gradient solver (EQSLV,PCG command) only   
 works for fully constrained model.  There are less than 3 constraints   
 in the current model.  The solver has been reset to sparse              
 (EQSLV,SPARSE).                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.359   TIME= 23:37:10
 Material number 2 (used by element 2241) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.359   TIME= 23:37:10
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       0.781   TIME= 23:37:10
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UY   
 degree of freedom of node 1252).  Please check for an insufficiently    
 constrained model.
